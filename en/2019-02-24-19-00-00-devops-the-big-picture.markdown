DevOps is not about productivity. At least not *essentially* about productivity. It does allow us to do more with the same level of resources, or *even less*, which is what defines an increase in productivity (quantity of output/(quantity of work + quantity of resources), but that's not its goal.

In my view, DevOps is a set of practices that redirects the energy flow from superfluous, energy-wasting processes to essential, energy-efficient ones. I say *the* energy flow, because there exists only one, *true*, energy flow, resulting from the Big Bang, 13.79 billion years ago. Everything we do as humans is exchanging energy with that flow, converting it from useless to useful energy. Mathematically:

human labor (useful energy) + natural resources (useless energy) = useful stuff + lost energy (useless energy)

Ultimately, the sum of energies is zero. But the utility (satisfaction) we get from the "useful stuff" is greater than the utility we get from conserving our labor.

utility(human labor + natural resources) < utility(useful stuff + lost energy)

I guess utility ultimately means comfort, leisure time, traveling, spending time with your wife and kids, visiting your parents. In other words, utility means less work. But I love my work. #TGIM. Ya need to #hustle. I totally get you! I really like my job too. It's just that your job should be net present value of energy (E-NPV) positive. I guess 80+ hours/week are okay if you're doing something that is *really* world changing. You're improving the lives of so many human beings, including yours, that your effort ends upt being positive net energy utility. Something you do to improve your surroundings, our community, the world. Why does Elon Musk work so much? He builds electrical cars, which reduces waste of energy. He builds rockets, so that we can explore the Universe to a) get more sources of energy, currently out of reach and b) outlive the Earth. So the work he does is essentially devoted to *reduce* energy waste and improve humanity's utility.


When that happens, we're converting the energy from the flow (which is useless) into useful energy. The energy remains the same at all times, but it does become more valuable.

So everytime we do something that is energy
