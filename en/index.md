    <h2>Software engineer</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Raphael and I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.konduto.com" target="_blank">Konduto</a>, Brazil's best fraud prevention company :D</p>
    <p>
        I graduated in Computer Engineering at the University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2013 and started to work at Konduto right after, but my first job in the industry was back in 2011 as an intern.
    </p>
    <p>
        My strongest skill is asynchronous backend code, with plenty of experience in Vert.x (Java). I'm also a web developer and know Ruby on Rails, ember.js, CSS and HTML5. My work at Konduto involves data engineering, for which I use R and Pandas (Python). During my career I've worked with MySQL, mongodb and DynamoDB. By the way, AWS tools, such as EC2, SES, SQS, Cloudformation and S3 are all part of my daily work. Besides all that very technical stuff I also enjoy reading about agile methods, CI/CD and everything that can help improve the flow of work.

    <h2>Master of Economics</h2>
    <p>
        I'm also a Master of Economics and my thesis examines whether greener REITs (real estate investment trusts) have competitive advantage. Feel free to <a href="/en/contact.html">contact me</a> if you want to read it :)

    <h2>Airplanes, soccer and music</h2>
    <p>
    I've loved airplanes since I was a kid and now I actually fly them. My logbook consists of 30 hours flying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Cessna_152" target="_blank">Cessna 150/152</a> and 4 hours flying the <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.com/wiki/Cessna_172" target="_blank">Cessna 172</a>. I also enjoy playing soccer and strumming some distorted chords on the guitar.
