    <h2>Software engineer</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Raphael and I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.konduto.com" target="_blank">Konduto</a>, Brazil's best fraud prevention company :D</p>
    <p>
        I graduated in Computer Engineering at the University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2013 and started to work at Konduto right after, but my first job in the industry was back in 2011 as an intern.
    </p>
    <p>
        My strongest skill is asynchronous backend code, with plenty of experience in Vert.x (Java). I've also worked as a web developer and know Ruby on Rails, ember.js, CSS and HTML5. My work at Konduto involves data engineering, for which I use R and Pandas (Python). During my career I've worked with MySQL, mongodb and DynamoDB. AWS tools, such as EC2, SES, SQS, Cloudformation and S3 are all part of my daily work. I also enjoy reading about everything that can help improve the flow of work (CI, CD, Kanban, ...). Oh and before I forget, I'm also a big fan of containers and their orchestration.

    <h2>Master of Economics</h2>
    <p>
        I'm also a Master of Economics and my thesis examines whether greener REITs (real estate investment trusts) have competitive advantage. Feel free to <a href="/en/contact.html">contact me</a> if you want to read it :)

    <h2>Airplanes, soccer and music</h2>
    <p>
    I've loved airplanes since I was a kid and now I actually fly them. My logbook consists of 30+ hours flying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Cessna_152" target="_blank">Cessna 150/152</a> and 4 hours flying the <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.com/wiki/Cessna_172" target="_blank">Cessna 172</a>. I also enjoy playing soccer and strumming some distorted chords on the guitar.
